Predicting worldwide conflict using machine learning models and UNICEF data
<br>
•	Worked with data from UNICEF and Dr. Schwartz using statistical methods like hypothesis testing, correlation estimation, linear regression, classification to predict conflict worldwide and assess the machine learning models, (xgboost, ffnn, transformer). 
<br>
•	Developed easy-to-understand visualizations for a non-technical audience and tided data set to minimize errors in analysis.
<br>
•	Created a new model for UNICEF with 88% accuracy that minimizes overfitting, accurately predicting real-world conflict.
